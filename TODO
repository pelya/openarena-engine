Next release:
Remove "Shoot under finger" and "Aim under finger" controls.
Camera rotate button above the joystick does not work, it sends 'centerview' VM command.
Show PC servers by default, put them into the same list as Android servers.
Make sure mouse+keyboard controls work when playing on PC servers.
Hide touchscreen controls when right mouse button is clicked.
"Tap to shoot" - make crosshair smaller when stopped shooting. Preferrably in engine and not in VM.
"Floating crosshair" - do not switch to first-person zoom, as it is buggy, implement 3-rd person zoom without bugs.
Add dynamic camera button to joystick, add option for joystick tap action.
Tap to aim for aiming modes with shoot button.
Option for the second tap to stop shooting in tap to shoot mode.
Option to disable joystick jump.
Visual feedback when you start and stop shooting on tap (crosshair size change).
Zooming is totally broken, camera jumps upwards all the time.
Mount .obb file as a filesystem, 'openarena +set fs_basepath $APPDIR' and make symlinks to ANDROID_OBB_MOUNT_DIR

Distant future:
Move all controls to the engine, so that VM from the PC version can be played with touchscreen + gyro.
Only "Tap to shoot" and "Shoot button" will be supported.
Move swipe to rotate 180 degrees and camera rotate button from VM to the engine.
Make camera rotate button a part of the joystick and not a separate button, draw left/right arrow on it.

Minor:
Fix chat messages split incorrectly
When waiting for answer from masterserver on bad connection, GUI freezes
Voting breaks map rotation on dedicated server
